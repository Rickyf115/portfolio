          <p>
            When faced with a choice we usually turn to our ethics to make sure 
            which string of actions we take is adequate for our current work environment 
            and for ourselves asprofessionals, do you think about them when you face issues 
            or just even regular day to day choices? Before we begin speaking about ethics we 
            first must identify what exactly a code of ethics is. A code of ethics is set of rules 
            set for professionals in a workplace to make it possibleto predict the outcome of a set 
            of choices (good or bad) and helps you determine whether theycould cause trouble for you or 
            your company in the future based on different categories thatthose choices could fall under. 
            John C. Maxwell lists 5 very broad key words known asMaxwell’s 5 P’s. When choosing between different options Maxwell 
            suggest you look over them and try to associate them with any of these 5 P’s, if you are successful in any one, 
            you might want to stop pursuing that choice that aligns with that. Ethics aren’t just to figure out whatchoices are wrong, 
            they are also used to understand how much you have grown as aprofessional, the IEEE code of Ethics lists 10 different Ethics 6 virtues 
            and values that you alsopossess to become a successful professional.

            During our group meeting we discussed our privacy as users to companies and data ownership. 
            Large companies like google, Microsoft, even Wal-Mart are collecting informationfrom us every minute that we use their services.
            As consumers in this day and age, most peopledon’t mind such, it won’t really stop anyone from using their services, 
            but it can be scary tosome. As we technology evolves there are many technologies being developed that would severely violate what is our privacy, 
            for example, police body cams that tag people that areunfortunate enough to walk by said police officer. Google keeps track of our habits whensearching 
            and information of every single thing we search to create suggestions for the future and make this search engine the most seamless user experience ever 
            developed. Thing is, that is A LOT of information being collected about us, google knows just about everything about me, my birth date, my full name, what 
            I like, what I don’t like, etc. I wouldn’t even be surprised if they have an algorithm that would be able to track my entire family tree just from a couple 
            of searches and a google account. Most companies when confronted with accusations of keeping our information and making profit from it usually say they don’t 
            even store such information but time and time again they are proven wrong, which shows a lack of honesty being given to us by said companies. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            During our meeting we concluded that companies taking and using this information really won’t stop anyone from using their amazing software or 
            really even try to hide much information about themselves, since most of the time that information just makes every single experience with their 
            software that much more seamless. But it is still a violation of our privacyand that collection of our personal information should not be stored by 
            these companies, sinceat any time, these companies could shut down and sell all our personal information for a large sum of money and still have it 
            all be legal, since they own all the data that was collected on us. I feel like in this case companies could show a lack of honesty, possibly a lack of 
            fidelity if said information is sold to others, and a large responsibility is also weighed on them, given they are holding very sensitive information 
            of millions of people, which can be very dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands.
