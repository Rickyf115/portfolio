  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a student at Iowa State University working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.<br /><br /> I enjoy spending my time working on personal projects to immerse myself into new languages and technologies for development. When I'm not
    working on such, you could find me trying to conquer a new trick on my skateboard, seeking to become better, faster and stronger through exercise, or even working on my custom built computer.<br /><br /> I will be graduating with the class of 2019
    and searching to find internships/employment as a software developer.
